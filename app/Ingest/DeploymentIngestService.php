/**

 * external_id) so a re-delivery advances the same record instead of duplicating
 * it. On a terminal `succeeded` deploy it advances the environment's version
 * through {@see DeployCensusService}, so the census becomes a projection of this
 * history rather than a hand-set snapshot. Every persist announces
 * {@see DeploymentRecorded} — the seam release-health and automation subscribe to.
