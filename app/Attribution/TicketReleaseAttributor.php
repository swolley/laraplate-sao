/**
 * The guarded write path for ticket-to-release attribution: it enforces the
 * asymmetry that a ticket is `affected` by any maturity but resolved only on
 * stable. Attaching `shipped` requires the release to carry a `stable` tag;
 * `promised` accepts an announced release; `affected` accepts any, including an
 * uncurated `observed` version. This is where the rule lives, not in the UI.
 *
 * The VCS-driven {@see ReleaseAttributionService} is compliant by construction —
 * it only ships a release after registering a stable tag — so it keeps its own
 * monotonic upsert; this attributor serves the affected and manual paths.
